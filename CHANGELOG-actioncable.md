# Changelog — yrby-actioncable

All notable changes to the `yrby-actioncable` gem are documented here. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- **Internal:** ActionCable stream-name prefix `y_ruby:` → `yrby:`.
  Server-internal (broadcast + `stream_from` both use it) — no public API or
  client-facing wire change. Depends on `yrby >= 0.2.1`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-28

First release. The y-websocket sync channel concern is **`Y::ActionCable::Sync`**,
loaded with `require "y/action_cable"`. Depends on `yrby >= 0.2.0`.

### Notes
- Full y-websocket protocol over ActionCable/AnyCable: origin-filtered relay,
  awareness, on_load/on_save persistence hooks, optional record-before-distribute
  audit mode, and AnyCable `sync_backend :store`.
